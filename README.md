# Urban Jungle Juggle

As urban jungles continue to trend, people will continue to collect rarer and more unique plants in their collections. UJJ will keep a database for all their plants with their own individual care needs.

Users will be able to add, update, and remove plants from their database as their urban jungle evolves.

## Planning Story
This app began with simple sketches. A skeleton of the app was built with simple html elements.

As the features developed the html structure was adjusted and as new technologies became more familiar, the layout evolved even further.


 ## User Stories
* As a user I'll be able to sign into my personal account.
* As a user I'll be able to add new plants to my database.
* As a user I'll be able to edit the plant profile and care instructions
* As a user I'll be able to see all plants in my database.
* As a user I'll be able to delete plants from my database.

## Technologies Used
* jQuery
* HTML/CSS
* Javascript

## Unsolved Problems/Future Plans
* Future versions will allow for care comments to be logged for the duration of the life of the plant
* Future versions will allow for more detailed views of the plant
* Future versions will incorporate a more streamlined UI for User sign in/outs.
* Future versions will have a better stylized status bar
* Future versions will have significant UI/UX enhancements overall
